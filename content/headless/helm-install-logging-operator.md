Install the Logging operator into the *logging* namespace:

```shell
helm upgrade --install --wait --create-namespace --namespace logging logging-operator oci://ghcr.io/kube-logging/helm-charts/logging-operator
```

Expected output:

```shell
Release "logging-operator" does not exist. Installing it now.

> Note:
> 
> - Helm has a known issue in version 3.13.0 that requires users to log in to the registry, even though the repo is public.
> 
>     Upgrade to 3.13.1 or higher to avoid having to log in, see: https://github.com/kube-logging/logging-operator/issues/1522
> - If you're installing the Helm chart from Terraform, reference the repository as `repository = "oci://ghcr.io/kube-logging/helm-charts/"` (without the `logging-operator` suffix). Otherwise, you'll get a [403 Forbidden error](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-helm/issues/1291).
